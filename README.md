In this paper we attempt to provide unified security and privacy multilateral security architecture for cloud services stack, using key latest technology via LxC in general and Docker containers in specific. Docker is one of the first to use LxC at such a large scale, but LxC is not a very new concept, it is around for quite some time. Docker container service is a key Platform as a Service (PaaS) based engine. Unified layered cloud computing multilateral security implementation addresses the potential risks associated with cloud computing environment. It also specifies when, at what time, where, and how to apply security controls. Unified Design includes the structured connection between the components of cloud ecosystem for basket and bucket of unified cloud-based hybrid services using micro service oriented venture architectural services realized in terms of PAAS using Docker container as a service. We surveyed various industry/academic professionals and based on our experience we tried to understand the challenges they faced while using the cloud system. We tried to understand the security challenges, incidents, story pieces, accidents, experience they faced while designing, implementing and using the cloud services/resources virtually via online. This work helps to assess the security design and architecture quality using multilateral security framework for Docker container. We try to present the architecture using OSI/TCP/IP stack model with reference to Cloud service stack model and deployment stack model and try to propose the balanced multilateral security prototype with reference to Docker Container security architecture.
